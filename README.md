# 🏏 IPL Runs Analysis Project  

**A Deep Dive into IPL's Legendary Batsmen and Their Records**  

---

## 📄 Project Description  
This project is my hands-on attempt to analyze and visualize the IPL Runs Dataset, focusing on players' performances over the years. By leveraging Python and its powerful libraries, I explored data trends, insights, and batting performances in one of the world’s most exciting cricket leagues.  

The project covers:  
- Data Exploration and Cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature Engineering and Visualization  
- Insightful Observations  

The aim? To sharpen my data analytics skills while diving into the cricketing world I love.

📊 Dataset
Source: IPL Runs Dataset
Size: 1,986 rows × 13 columns
Features: Player Name, Matches, Innings, Runs, Strike Rate, Centuries, Boundaries, etc.
The dataset was clean and well-structured—a rare blessing for any data analyst! 🎉

🤔 Challenges Faced
Duplicates: Tackled rows that seemed identical but had subtle differences.
Visualizing Centuries: Ensured meaningful visualizations to highlight players’ impact.
Balancing Analysis with Insights: Focusing on both granular details and the bigger picture.
